# Architecture decision records

Each record captures one decision: the context that forced it, the options considered, and the consequences we accepted. Records are immutable once accepted; a changed decision gets a new record that amends or supersedes the old one. Proposals that precede decisions live in [`../rfcs/`](../rfcs/README.md).
